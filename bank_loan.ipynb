    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit risk assessment is one of the most critical tasks in the banking and financial industry. Lenders must evaluate the likelihood that a borrower will repay or default on a loan before issuing credit. Poor risk assessment can lead to increased default rates, reduced profitability, and long-term financial instability for lending institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses a synthetic but realistic dataset of 45,000 loan applicants containing demographic, financial, and credit history attributes. The goal is to explore and analyze how factors such as **income, employment experience, credit score,** and **loan characteristics** influence the probability of loan repayment or default.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial institutions face continuous challenges in balancing loan approvals with risk management. Approving too many risky loans increases default losses, while being overly strict limits profit opportunities.\n",
    "This project aims to analyze applicant data to identify the characteristics of **high-risk borrowers** and the key variables that influence **loan repayment outcomes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Understand the demographic and financial profiles of loan applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** Analyze relationships between applicant attributes (income, credit score, education) and loan repayment outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** Quantify how loan characteristics such as interest rate and purpose impact default risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** Segment borrowers into low-risk and high-risk categories based on SQL-based insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.** Generate actionable insights to support data-driven lending and credit approval policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**>** What percentage of applicants defaulted versus successfully repaid their loans?\n",
    "\n",
    "**>** How does credit score affect default likelihood?\n",
    "\n",
    "**>** Is there a connection between income levels and repayment performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**>** Do borrowers with previous loan defaults have a higher probability of defaulting again?\n",
    "\n",
    "**>** Which loan purposes (e.g., personal, education, medical) carry the highest credit risk?\n",
    "\n",
    "**>** How do employment experience and home ownership relate to loan repayment outcomes?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "**~** SQL queries and analytical summaries identifying patterns in credit risk behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**~** Key metrics (default rate, average credit score, average income) across loan and demographic segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**~** Identification of high-risk borrower profiles for targeted credit policy decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**~** Actionable recommendations to reduce defaults and improve loan approval accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Value\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provides data-driven insights to help banks and financial institutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Improve loan approval strategies by understanding applicant risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** Develop better credit scoring models using real-world variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.**Reduce overall default rates and enhance profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengthen risk management and compliance frameworks with analytical evidence."
